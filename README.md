- Groundhog Day: An annual event held on February 2nd across the United States, where it is tradition to watch the behavior of a groundhog emerging from its burrow. According to folklore, if the groundhog sees its shadow due to clear weather, it will retreat back into its den, and there will be six more weeks of winter. If it does not see its shadow because of cloudiness, spring will arrive early.
