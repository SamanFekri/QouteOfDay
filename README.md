### Events
------
As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, specific events scheduled for April 24, 2023, in the USA are not universally significant as national holidays or observances. However, certain events may be planned for that date. Examples could include:

- Local festivals or fairs
- Academic conferences or symposiums
- Sporting events such as baseball games, since Major League Baseball (MLB) is in season during April
- Concerts or live music performances
- Community service
