As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, specific events scheduled for May 20 in the USA can vary widely from year to year. However, here are some types of events that might typically occur on that date:

- **Memorial Day Parades**: Although Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May, some communities may hold parades or events on the weekend leading up to it, which could include May 20th if it falls on a weekend.
  
- **Graduation
