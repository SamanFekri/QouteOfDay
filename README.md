As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, I cannot provide you with real-time or future events. However, I can tell you that in the United States, the first Saturday in May is traditionally when the Kentucky Derby is held. This event is a major horse race that takes place in Louisville, Kentucky, and it is a longstanding American tradition. Assuming it continues as scheduled, here's what you could expect on May 6, 2023:
