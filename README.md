------
As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, there is no single event that is guaranteed to occur every year on May 14th in the USA, as events can vary from year to year. However, I can mention typical types of events that might take place on that date in a given year:

- **Local Festivals:** Various towns and cities may have annual festivals or fairs.
- **Concerts:** Musical performances by artists on tour during that time.
- **Sports Events
