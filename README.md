As of my last update, I can provide a general historical perspective on events that might occur annually in the USA on April 9. However, specific events for the year the question might be referring to (2023 or beyond) would not be available to me. Here are some examples of events that could happen on April 9 in any given year:

- **National Cherish an Antique Day**: This is a day for appreciating the value and beauty of antiques and the history they represent.
