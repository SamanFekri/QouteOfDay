As of my last update in early 2023, I can mention a recurring event that typically happens on April 16th in the United States:

- **Tax Day** (usually April 15 but can be observed on the next business day if the 15th is a weekend or holiday)
  - Deadline for individuals to file their federal income tax returns and make tax payments.
  - Internal Revenue Service (IRS) processes millions of tax filings.
  - Many accountants and tax preparers
