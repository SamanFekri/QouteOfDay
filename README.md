As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, one of the notable events that is recognized annually on June 24th in the United States is:

- Saint John's Day: Also known as the Feast of Saint John the Baptist, this is a Christian holiday not specific to the U.S. but celebrated by some Christian denominaries in America. The feast day falls near the time of the summer solstice and is intended to celebrate the birth of John the Baptist.

Keep in mind that June
