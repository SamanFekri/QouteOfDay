As of my last update in early 2023, there isn't a single event that perennially happens on February 8th in the United States, as annual events can change dates from year to year. However, historical events have occurred on that date, and there might be specific events scheduled for February 8th in a given year. Here are some possibilities:

- **National Boy Scouts Day**: This day celebrates the creation of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910. February 8
