As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, specific events that will take place on April 21 in any given year in the USA can vary widely, as event schedules are subject to annual changes. However, I can provide some examples of types of events that might typically take place on that date:

- **National Park Week Celebrations**: April is when National Park Week is celebrated, which might include special events and free admission days at national parks across the country.

- **Earth Day Events
