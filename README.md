As of my last update in early 2023, I can provide general information on annual events that typically occur in the United States around May 7. Please keep in mind that specific events can change from year to year, and you would need to check the current year's calendar for precise details. Here are some types of events that have historically taken place around this date:

- **The Kentucky Derby**: This prestigious horse race is held annually in Louisville, Kentucky, on the first Saturday in May.
