As of my last knowledge update in March 2023, I do not have real-time data, which means I cannot provide you with current events scheduled for May 15, 2023. However, I can tell you about an annual event in the USA that often occurs around May 15:

- **Peace Officers Memorial Day**:
  - Part of National Police Week.
  - Held annually on May 15 to honor law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty.
