As of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, here are some events that have historically taken place or occur annually on March 10th in the United States:

- **Daylight Saving Time begins**: While this does not happen every year exactly on March 10, it often occurs around this date. In years when it does fall on this date, it's when clocks are set forward one hour, typically at 2:00 AM local time.
  
- **National Women and Girls HIV
