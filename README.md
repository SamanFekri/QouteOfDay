As of the knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, there is no single event that is guaranteed to occur on March 25th across the entire United States as an annual event. However, I can provide examples of types of events that might occur on that date in a given year:

- **Local Festivals or Fairs:** Many communities host seasonal festivals or fairs in the springtime, which may include art shows, food, music, and various forms of entertainment.
- **Sports Events
