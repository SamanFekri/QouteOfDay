Certainly! Here's an event that took place in the USA on August 22:

**August 22, 1864: The First Geneva Convention**
- An international treaty that established the standards of international law for humanitarian treatment in war.
- Although the treaty was signed in Geneva, Switzerland, it significantly influenced U.S. military conduct and its commitment to international humanitarian law.

To note, while the signing of the First Geneva Convention itself didn't occur in the USA, it had substantial implications for future U.S
