As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, a recurring event that takes place in the United States on May 26th is Memorial Day (observed). Memorial Day is a federal holiday that is observed on the last Monday of May each year. If May 26th falls on the last Monday, the following events would typically occur:

- **Memorial Day Observances**
  - National moment of remembrance at 3:00 PM local time
  - Ceremonies at Arlington
