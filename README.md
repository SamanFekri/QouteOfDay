------
As of my last update, specific events scheduled for May 9th in any given year in the USA can vary as this is not a federal holiday or a widely recognized annual event date. However, I can provide some examples of events that might typically occur on this date:

- Local elections: In some years, certain areas might hold local government or school board elections on this date.
- School events: There might be school-related activities like concerts, sports events, or award ceremonies scheduled for May
