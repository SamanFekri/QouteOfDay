As of my last update in early 2023, specific events scheduled for June 7th in any given year in the USA can vary widely, from local community gatherings to potentially larger national celebrations or observances. However, there isn't a fixed annual event that occurs on June 7th each year across the entire country that is as universally recognized as, say, Independence Day on July 4th. 

That being said, I can provide a hypothetical list of what might be happening on June
